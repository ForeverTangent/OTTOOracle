## What is it?
Highlevel: This is Gamme Master Emulator for playing Tabletop RPGs by yourself, or for use as a writing tool.

Reality Level: An excuse for me to learn SwiftUI during Covid-19 lockdown fun.

## Background

OK, so during Covid-19, after finsihing most of my updates to my [SEAR-RL](http://constructive-noise.info/?cat=40) project, I have some free time and started reading some of my old RPG books.

From there and surfing the web, I discovered all these Solo RPG / GM Emulator systems, like Mythic,  GameMaster's Apprentice, and others, and I sort of became fascinated with how they worked.

The more I thought about them, the more I realised the basic code to impliment them would not be that nuts.   Similarly, I had been trying to learn Apple's new SwiftUI kit, and having a project would help do that.

So basically this whole project is just an experience thing to learn SwiftUI, and to get used to how to program in the MVVM style and all that comes with that.
