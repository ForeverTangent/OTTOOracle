## What is it?
Highlevel: This is Gamme Master Emulator for playing Tabletop RPGs by yourself, or for use as a writing tool.

Reality Level: An excuse for me to learn SwiftUI during Covid-19 lockdown fun.

## Background

OK, so during Covid-19, after finsihing most of my updates to my [SEAR-RL](http://constructive-noise.info/?cat=40) project, I have some free time and started reading some of my old RPG books.

I have never been much of an tabletop RPG gamer,  but I have always been fancinated by the worlds and systems.

So after ready the books I started surfing the web, I discovered all these Solo RPG / GM Emulator systems, like (Mythic GM Emulator)[http://wordmillgames.com], (GameMaster's Apprentice[https://www.larcenousdesigns.com], and others, and I sort of became fascinated with how they worked.

The more I thought about them, the more I realised the basic code to impliment them would not be that nuts.   Similarly, I had been trying to learn Apple's new SwiftUI kit, and having a project would help do that.

So basically this whole project is just an experience thing to learn SwiftUI, and to get used to how to program in the MVVM style and all that comes with that.

A lot of 

Specifcally the GM Emulator Models this project tries to impliment are:

* (Mythic GM Emulator)[http://wordmillgames.com]
* (GameMaster's Apprentice[https://www.larcenousdesigns.com]
* (CRGE)[http://conjecturegames.com/crge/]
* (UNE)[http://conjecturegames.com/une/]
* Fate Solo
* RPG Solo (seems to be a variation of So1um).
* Savage World's Wild Card genertor
* Cypher GM Emulator
* Cypher NPC Genertor
* 

There are not 100% exact too.  I have tweaked all the system a little bit for various reason.

But like I said this is just a hobby project, but if you get any use out of it, bonus.  And please I mean no infridgement on any of the developers of the systems.   This is just an intellectual exercise for me to learn stuff.
